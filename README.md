# beginners-code

Hello fellow programmers. 
I personally find coding very interesting. So, I've started to learn how to code.
I do have some knowledge of py, but, I found Haskell more interesting.

I will add a "haskell for beginners from beginners perspective".
Maybe in the future, I add more guides!
